# HIT-BUG
*I created this extension to help out someone who regularly deals with a buggy website. This mitigates the issues.*
*When used correctly, this will prevent webpages from forcing the user to go to the top of the web page*

Technical Details
---------------------------------------------------------
This was coded to focus on The Google Chrome Browser. I will not not be accepting issues if they are not Google Chrome related. All PR's welcome though. This code focuses on the issues presented when a certain website (there are others, not just tailored for one website!). Anyway, if a site has a bug or just wants to be an utter pain, it will try to force the screen to the top of the page. This extension will keep scrolling to where the user originally was, even while the site is scrolling up. The constant battle might cause some lag, which may be fixed in a later release.

Install Guide
